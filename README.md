**full name information leak in google drive**

in 2015 i discovered and reported this exploit found in both mapsengine and drive. mapsengine was patched, but it was evidently a feature in drive. many email accounts across several providers whose names aren't visible on g+ or in account recovery procedures become retrievable. this issue was disclosed to google back in 2015.

lulz full disclosure

ps garbage at php and fully aware that this is a lame "exploit" but it catches things the "to" field in gmail compose method and account recovery procedures miss.
